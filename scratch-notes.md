# Scratch Notes

Future: can drag and drop log entries to re-order session the entries regardless of the order in which they were originally created.

- Create a general note and save it to my account so I can retrieve the note the next time I log into the app
- Create a new session log â€“ which offers single click prompts to:
  - Create a character record:
    - Prompts the user with fields for character name (required), class, race, age, occupation, location met, where they can typically be found, quest(s) offered.
    - Note: the quest offered prompt should be linked to the database and show existing quests that the user can select to attach to the character as a quest they provided or, if the quest entry hasn't been created yet, the user can select a new quest option to recive a new quest form that can be completed and immediately assocaited with the character that prompted the creation of the new quest entry.
  - Create a new quest record:
    - Prompts the user with fields for quest name or single sentence description, quest source (can be a character, job board, discovered/self-assigned), quest requirements, quest knowledge.
    - Note: quest knowledge should expand to show options for adding specific types of knowledge records to the quest knowledge log: images (with option to add title, notes, and location), general text, quotations from characters (text that is/will be associated in the database to the quoted character)

(session log likely to be rendered as a stylized vertical timeline, tbd)

MVP will only work for a single campaign. Post-MVP should support toggling homepage view to show session logs and bank/storage data per campaign.

Make a record type for personal side-quests and "between game" events activities for campaigns where such mechanics are in place. Related, a mechanic or record type should exist for player-base-town if campaign mechanics involve town management.
